This workshop was started in live sessions, with the whole team working in tandem.
Much of the code providing core functionality was completed in this way by the whole team.
Please see the code for more specifics on who added what beyond this point. As a rough indication:

- Ronnie provided much of the functionality to add and remove products from packages, 
	handled validation, and played a big role in query building.
- Holly provided organization for the overall app, particularly mapping out what was needed for the
	non-packages side of things. She also designed the intial main page.
- Eric handled advanced layout and design of the pages, added extra functionality to the add/modify forms for 
	packages and product/suppliers, and played a role in query building.
- Chris handled the building of functionality for adding and modifying the Products and Suppliers tables,
	including their validation.
