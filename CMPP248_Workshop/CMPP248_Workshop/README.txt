Please note that the database has been updated for improvements to both Workshop 4 and 5. 
These changes have been incorporated into the initial .SQL file for the travel experts database.

*Please note that logins and passwords have been added for the existing customers in the database.
Their Logins are "Login1" through to "Login25", and each has a password of "Pass" 
(this password was done for convenience of testing; if attempting to use the update password
functionality in Workshop 5, it will need to meet the stricter password criteria there.)
Our display of past customer purchases lists information from both the Booking table and relevant details
of each bookingDetail associated - we recommend Login25 to see a customer with multi-line booking details.

Code attributions have been added throughout the projects. Please also note some contributions
outside of the code:

- While everyone kept their eye out, Holly did much quality testing for Workshop 4, Ronnie for Workshop 5.
- Ronnie provided a great deal for the presentation, with Holly also strongly contributing.
- Eric helped with determining project requirements and prompting communication.
- Holly and Ronnie each initialized one Workshop project on Github and helped facilitate live sessions.
